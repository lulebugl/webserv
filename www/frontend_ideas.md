# Frontend Ideas for Home Page Replacement

## Problem
Having the same upload section on both home page and upload page is redundant. Need alternatives that require minimal server-side work.

### 4. Configuration Display <!-- also nice -->
- **Just needs**: Read config file
- **Simple CGI**: `cat /path/to/config.conf`
- **Frontend**: Parse and display config in a nice format
- **Features**: Show current server settings, routes, etc.

### 7. API Testing Interface
- **HTTP method tester**: GET, POST, DELETE with custom headers
- **Response viewer**: Pretty-printed JSON/HTML responses
- **Request builder**: URL builder with query parameters
- **Status code checker**: Test different endpoints
